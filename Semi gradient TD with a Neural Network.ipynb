        "Welcome to Course 3 Programming Assignment 2. In the previous assignment, you implemented semi-gradient TD with State Aggregation for solving a **policy evaluation task**. In this assignment, you will implement **semi-gradient TD with a simple Neural Network** and use it for the same policy evaluation problem.\n",

Each episode begins with the agent at the center and terminates when the agent goes far left beyond state 1 or far right beyond state 500. At each time step, the agent selects to move either left or right with equal probability. The environment determines how much the agent moves in the selected direction.\n",

        "In this section, you will implement an Agent that learns with semi-gradient TD with a neural network. You will use a neural network with one hidden layer. The input of the neural network is the one-hot encoding of the state number. We use the one-hot encoding of the state number instead of the state number itself because we do not want to build the prior knowledge that integer number inputs close to each other have similar values. The hidden layer contains 100 rectifier linear units (ReLUs) which pass their input if it is bigger than one and return 0 otherwise. ReLU gates are commonly used in neural networks due to their nice properties such as the sparsity of the activation and having non-vanishing gradients. The output of the neural network is the estimated state value. It is a linear function of the hidden units as is commonly the case when estimating the value of a continuous target using neural networks.\n",

To initialize the network's parameters, use **self.rand_generator.normal()** which draws random samples from a normal distribution.

We set the step-size for semi-gradient TD with tile-coding to $\\frac{0.1}{\\text{# tilings}}$. See the figure below for the comparison between semi-gradient TD with tile-coding and semi-gradient TD with a neural network and Adam algorithm. This result is for 5000 episodes and 20 runs:\n",

They are also capable of producing features without exclusively relying on hand-crafted mechanisms. On the other hand, compared to a linear function approximator with tile-coding, neural networks can be less sample efficient. When implementing your own Reinforcement Learning agents, you may consider these strengths and weaknesses to choose the proper function approximator for your problems."
